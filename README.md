A data app I made for CS411 - Database Systems at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I was given an academic world dataset, which included data on institutions, faculty, publications, and keywords. I loaded this dataset into three different databases — MySQL, Neo4j, and MongoDB — and accessed data using the respective Python driver. For the frontend, I used the Dash app framework for Python.
